nestor is a full-stack javascript, web-based media center built on nodejs and HTML.  It enables users to access their media library from anywhere and is built with extensibility in mind, as nearly every component is a plugin.

nestor uses the following technologies and libraries:

* [nodejs] with [express] and [socket.io]
* [MongoDB] and the [mongoose] ODM
* modern HTML with audio/video players, storage, offline and fullscreen APIs
* [Chromecast] support

The ENSERG (École Nationale Supérieure d'Électronique et de Radioélectricité de Grenoble) was a french computing, electronics and electromagnetics Grande École.  It was transferred in 2008 to the new school PHELMA.

The main two-year course included the following topics:

* Electronics
* Telecommunication & Networks
* VLSI & Computer Design
* Software engineering (C, C++, Java, microcontroller & DSP assembly)

The course included two mandatory internships:

* 3-month internship at **Grenoble ICP** (Institut de la Communication Parlée), where I worked on MATLAB to enable modeling the vocal tract of mammals.
* 6-month internship at **Sagem Mobile Phones, Paris**, where I studied integrating new EABI toolchains in the company building process for mobile phone software on Texas Instruments ARM7 & ARM9 platforms.

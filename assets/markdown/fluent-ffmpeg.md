[node-fluent-ffmpeg] is a nodejs module that abstracts usage of ffmpeg to convert audio and video streams with an easy to use syntax.  It leverages nodejs streams for greater flexibility.

After [many contributions](https://github.com/schaermu/node-fluent-ffmpeg/commits?author=njoyard) to enhance the API, stabilize the code and the test suite and add new features, I became a maintainer for node-fluent-ffmpeg and started handling issues, pull requests and continued to contribute new features.

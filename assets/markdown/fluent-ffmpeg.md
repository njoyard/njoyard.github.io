[node-fluent-ffmpeg] is a nodejs module that abstracts usage of ffmpeg to convert audio and video streams with an easy to use syntax.  It leverages nodejs streams for greater flexibility.

I do [many contributions][commits] to enhance the API, stabilize the code, enhance the test suite reliability and coverage, and add new features.  I also actively handle issues on a daily basis.
